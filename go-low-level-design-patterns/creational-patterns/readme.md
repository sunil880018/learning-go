### How objects are created and managed.

```sh
| Pattern            | Used For                                  | Real-world Example                                         |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Singleton**      | Global shared resource, only one instance | DB connection pool, logger, config loader                  |
| **Factory Method** | Creating objects without exposing logic   | Payment gateways (Razorpay, Stripe), notification services |
| **Builder**        | Building complex objects step-by-step     | SQL query builders, HTTP request builders                  |
| **Prototype**      | Cloning expensive or configurable objects | API response templates, config cloning, caching            |
