# Chat Application (Go + WebSockets)

## ðŸ”¹ High-Level Flow

### 1. HTTP Server Setup (`main.go`)

- Serves templates (`index.html`, `chat.html`).
- Serves static files (CSS, JS).
- Handles `/room` route â†’ upgrades HTTP connection to a WebSocket connection.

### 2. Room Management (`room.go`)

- Each room keeps track of connected clients.
- Messages sent in the room are broadcast to **all connected clients**.

### 3. Client Handling (`client.go`)

- Each client represents a single user connected via WebSocket.
- `read()` â†’ listens for incoming messages from this user.
- `write()` â†’ sends outgoing messages to this user.
